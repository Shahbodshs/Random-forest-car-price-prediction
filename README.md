# Random forest algorithm for car price predticion:
In this repository, you can have access to a code sample where im using EDA, to clean the data, and im doing some feature engineering to the dataset and then train the model for prediction. 
the dataset had several unnecessary informations like many types of color names for internal and external color of the car. 
i got help from this code : [EDA + neuralnet](https://www.kaggle.com/code/zarnainsyed0/eda-feature-engr-neuralnets-couldn-t-get-better) to clean the data a little bit better. \b 
but i didnt want to remove the model column so i used smoothed mean for the model and brand columns. 
then i tried to do some label encoding for some features like int_col and etc. 

the code is in kaggle in provided in this link : [Random forest - car price prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shahbodsobhkhiz/random-forest-car-price-prediction).
